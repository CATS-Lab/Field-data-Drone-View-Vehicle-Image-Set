# Drone-View-Vehicle-Image-Set

## Description

Drone-View-Vehicle-Image-Set consists of 5000 bounding boxes of drone-view vehicles. The annotations for vehicles are provided in two formats: XML and TXT.

This dataset was collected by the research team on Park Street in Madison in 2022. The vehicle trajectories can be found at the following GitHub repository: [Filed-data-Corridor-Vehicle-Trajectory](https://github.com/CATS-Lab/ANL2-Perception-TrajectoryDetection).

## Annotations

The annotations are provided in the following formats:

- XML: Each XML file contains the bounding box coordinates for vehicles in the corresponding image.
- TXT: Each TXT file contains the bounding box coordinates for vehicles in a simple text format.

## Usage
This dataset can be used for training YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 models. The training accuracy achieved with this dataset is 99%.
